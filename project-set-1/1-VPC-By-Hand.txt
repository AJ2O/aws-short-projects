1. Create VPC
    - Name = "VPC By Hand"
    - CIDR Block = 10.0.0.0/16
        - 2^16 available IPs starting from 10.0.0.0
        - 2^16 - 5 IPs, since AWS reserves some:
            - .0 - Network Address
            - .1 - VPC Router
            - .2 - DNS Server
            - .3 - Future Use
            - Last IP - Network Broadcast Address
    - Tenancy = Default
        - Shared, multi-tenant hardware for instances by default
        - Dedicated means single-tenant, and overrides instance tenancy
    - Tags
        - User
            - Who it belongs to, responsible for, etc.
        - Project
            - Use for this VPC
    - Create
        - Route Table generated
            - No IGW
            - Only communication within VPC
        - NACL generated
            - Inbound/Outbound traffic for all

2. Create IGW
    - Attach it to the VPC
    - Using CLI:
        - aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway --vpc-id "vpc-<id>" --internet-gateway-id "igw-<id>" --region us-east-1

3. Create Subnets in each AZ
    - Public & Private for AZs
    - Perhaps Public:Private ratio is 4:1
        - Ex. Public A - 10.0.0.0/24 = 256 IPs
        - Ex. Private A - 10.0.1.0/26 = 64 IPs

4. Route Tables
    - Create Public Route Table
        - Associate all Public Subnets
        - Attach IGW
        - Create route from 0.0.0.0/0 to IGW
    - Create Private Route Table
        - Associate all Private Subnets
        - We'll add a NAT Gateway later to this to allow for Internet connection
